## I. Introduction

- This project analyzes the correlation and influences that weather has on public bicycling in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area. 
- Using weather data taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the month of January, 2022, these influences were examined on bicycle riders under the Citi BikeShare community.
- The following analysis allows for the understanding and interpretation of how weather impacts commuting via bicycle for a large American city in contemporary times.


## II. Data-set

- Citi BikeShare is a rental company which allows users to rent bicycles. A rider unlocks a bike and pays per time or distance that they use the bike. After a ride is ended at a designated BikeShare location, thus ending the ride, the data is recorded in the BikeShare database. 
- Parameters recorded include the type of bike used, the start and end times, and the start and end geographical coordinates and the start and end stations. 
- The weather data includes the type of cloud cover, precipitation, and temperature for different times of day during the month of January, 2022. 
- Both data-sets thus align in their respective time-frames, with the BikeShare data-set recording over one million events for the month. 

	
## III. Analysis

- The premise of the analysis is to understand the correlation between several weather variables and BikeShare riders for the NYC area. 
- Both data-sets were accumulated into a SQL database for easier accessibility of each parameter. 
- Several weather related parameters were plotted against the types of bikes and number of riders for each day of the month. 
- Regression analysis was employed to determine the correlations between parameters in the two data-sets to observe trends in the data.
